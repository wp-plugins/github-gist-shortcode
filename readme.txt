Allows the use of a simple shortcode to embed GitHub Gists in a post or page.

== Description ==

Instead of embedding a [GitHub Gist](http://gist.github.com) (a [pastie](http://pastie.org/) like service on steroids) by copying and pasting HTML you can simple embed it with a [gist] shortcode.

For example, to embed the [gist: 30948](http://gist.github.com/30948) enter this in a post or page:

	[gist id=30948]
	
It is that simple.

== Installation ==

1) Download the plugin zip file.
2) Unzip.
3) Upload the github_gist_shortcode directory to your wordpress plugin directory (/wp-content/plugins).
4) Activate the plugin.
